# 02 Cosmos

## Why cosmos ?

- Represents a step change in architecture - generate future frames given current frame, auto regressively.
- Is claimed as a “world model”
- An Apache Licensed (model weights and source code) workload proxy for autoregressive video generation.
- Illustrative of taking a “model-in-the-wild” and making it run on AMD ecosystem without involving CUDA stickiness.


## What is Cosmos ?
- World Foundation model for Digital Twins and Physical AI
- Suite of tools with a Video model at the heart
	- Data curation/preparation
	- Advanced Tokenizers
	- Fine-tuning framework
	- Models of different sizes (edge to server)
	- Connectors to “Omniverse”

## What are the main value ?
- Open Physical AI development 
	- Both model weights, and software are open Apache License
	- Caveat: Model only runs on Nvidia HW for now
- Models work at various HW profiles from edge to cloud
- Synthetic data generation and data curation
- Omniverse + Cosmos as a simulation engine
